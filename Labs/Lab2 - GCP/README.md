In this tutorial, we will explore a structured dataset and then create training and evaluation datasets for a machine learning (ML) model. This is the first tutorial in a series of three; you can continue to Part 2, Training the Model, and Part 3, Deploying a Web Application.

You use the Google Cloud services Datalab for data exploration and Dataflow to create your datasets. The source dataset is stored in BigQuery.

Here's the architecture for this series of tutorials:
